<div class="text">
<p>One day, the fairies were playing acorn rugby in the field.</p>
<p>"Wow..." "Take that..." "Century..."</p>
<p>It's supposed to be playing, but they were feeling depressed for some reason.</p>
<p>"...Boring"</p>
<p>An acorn dropped and a fairy got out.</p>
<p>"I'm empty..." "Poor little us..." "I don't care..."</p>
<p>Fairies don't feel well unless they have close relations with humans.</p>
<p>But they always want to play.</p>
<p>"...Is that working?"</p>
<p>The fairies give each other a quick glance.</p>
<p>"Working?" "Labor?" "The end."<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>1<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>&nbsp;"Resume." "Entry, entry." "Should be worried." "Search." "Leave for a nice black company?"<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>2<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The black company is the only good company for fairies who want to be toyed with.</p>
<p>Out of nowhere, one pulled out a thick job file and the fairies started looking for jobs.</p>
<figure><a class="mw-file-description" href="/photos/jintai/JintaiHeijouUntenCH1_pt1.jpg"><img class="mw-file-element" src="/photos/jintai/JintaiHeijouUntenCH1_pt1.jpg&amp;width=300" srcset="/photos/jintai/JintaiHeijouUntenCH1_pt1.jpg&amp;width=450 1.5x, /photos/jintai/JintaiHeijouUntenCH1_pt1.jpg&amp;width=600 2x" alt="" width="300" height="208" data-file-width="1125" data-file-height="779" /></a>

<p>They went through all the favorable conditions such as high salary guarantee, complete two-day work week system, complete benefits package, and overtime work, and checked only the job vacancies that would ensure that they would work in a poor environment.</p>
<p>"Where are you?" "Do overtime pay." "Ah, a disappointment..."</p>
<p>"Is light work easy?" "Light work, hard work." "It's so-so."</p>
<p>"Your salary raise only proves it." "Turnover rate is at a minimum of 50% or more." "At a minimum, 500 hours per load over."</p>
<p>It was crazy.</p>
<p>So when they were all looking for it, in the recruitment vote it was found that it was a great (fairy standard) recruitment.</p>
<p>"Th-this is...!"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A wide and long road runs through the Kusunoki village.</p>
<p>It continues all the way from downtown to the suburbs.</p>
<p>Mr. N, who finished his field work, walked slowly along such a path.</p>
<p>Mr. N discovered something unfamiliar to the street.</p>
<p>"Hey, what exactly is this? It shouldn't have been here yesterday."</p>
<p>It was a fairly large cardboard box.</p>
<p>A rectangle that is taller than an adult and has a vertical shape.</p>
<p>Part of the front is cut out like a small window and sealed with transparent cellophane. And beyond that, small items were displayed.</p>
<p>Maybe this is a vending machine? Mr. N tilts his head.</p>
<p>You can see a real vending machine if you go anywhere in this world. It's so ancient that it sometimes comes out of the soil as a ruin.</p>
<p>However, at the present time without a monetary system, it is a machine that does not make much sense.</p>
<p>Moreover, cardboard is a paper craft for children.</p>
<p>He looked at the product.</p>
<p>There were rows of decaying photographs, acorns and leaves, stones, and rusty nails. In particular, one of them, a pop advertisement "Recommended!" is posted on the glittering crown.</p>
<p>"...I don't need any of this."</p>
<p>Mr. N loses interest and leaves the front of the cardboard vending machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"This month's sales target is 500 chocolate coins! Currently...0 coins."</p>
<p>Under the big poster, the Fairy President turned around in his chair, said this.</p>
<p>"Not good enough. I did this when I was younger."</p>
<p>Fairies in suits looked at each other with troubled looks.</p>
<p>"But that's, that's why it's not good to decrease the lineup."</p>
<p>One fairy came out in front and bravely announced.</p>
<p>"Not going to happen."</p>
<p>The current lineup determines future profits.</p>
<p>"The degree of our customer satisfaction currently is low."</p>
<p>"It's low."</p>
<p>Customer satisfaction is the lifeblood of a company.</p>
<p>"There's not enough appeal?"</p>
<p>"Appeal..."</p>
<p>Appeal is important.</p>
<p>"It's perfect!"</p>
<p>The Fairy President jumps onto the desk.</p>

<p>"This is the President's command. Do you want to develop a new product? Do it by tomorrow!"</p>
<p>"But, President."</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"We're subcontractors, why are we doing it?"</p>
<p>The company was quiet given the current scene.</p>
<p>The subcontractor is a brother, and the subcontractor is a family.</p>
<p>By helping each other out, we can live in this world of eternal decline... An important subcontractor may die from overwork. What should we do?</p>
<p>A word from the President breaks silence.</p>
<p>"...Isn't it your job to do that?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no telling how many people died, but the new product has been completed regardless.</p>
<p>It was displayed on the vending machine the next day.</p>
<p>"Ahahaha ♪ a new~everyday, que será será~♪"<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>3<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>A girl of good age walked along the road while the soft sunshine flushed her cheeks. It was a girl with blonde, curly hair.</p>
<p>And then she came across them. Cardboard vending machines.</p>
<p>"What the hell is this...?"</p>
<p>The girl didn't know, but the items on display were redesigned.</p>
<p>Human's (current head of Kusunoki office) bromide, large acorns, a selection of leaves, fine stones, non-rusting nails, etc.</p>
<p>The girl's eyes flashed.</p>
<p>"Well well well, what is this?"</p>
<p>The girl seems to be particularly interested in one product.</p>
<p>"I wonder if this is that so-called thing. The one where if you insert coins, things will come out."</p>
<p>There was a slit at the bottom of the product window to put something in.</p>
<p>If you put something in here, things will come out. It seemed that the design could be judged from an ergonomic perspective.</p>
<p>The girl looked around.</p>
<p>"Digging up the ground in a place like this..."</p>
<p>When she put a mark on the surface, she pulled out her rustic knife that was hanging on her waist and started digging the ground.</p>
<p>As an aside, this girl looks like a doll, but she also loved rustic knives. The military knife is the best. She has so many that she could be considered a criminal.</p>
<p>"It came out!"</p>
<p>Old coins came out from the soil.</p>
<p>In fact, coins are everywhere. They have no use.</p>
<p>"I'll put this in."</p>
<p>She slips the coin into the slit.</p>
<p>Then...the roulette wheel of the vending machine started spinning.</p>
<p>"What? Maybe you can choose a product...?"</p>
<p>Actually, she can't choose. There is no button for each product.</p>
<p>Yes...it's a random vending machine.</p>
<p>There was a rattling noise as the product fell into the lower outlet.</p>
<p>The girl took out a terrifying product.</p>
<p>Congrats. You get the fine stones.♪</p>
<p>"......Eh."</p>
<p>The curly-haired girl threw away the very rare, high-quality stone in silence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"This month's sales target is 500 chocolate coins! Currently...0 coins."</p>
<p>Said by the Fairy President who looked up from his chair.</p>
<p>"The new product was useless."</p>
<p>"However, isn't the human capricious?"</p>
<p>"...That's why I can't do it."</p>
<p>"...That's right."</p>
<p>Humans who are not selfish are not humans! Boring!</p>
<p>That kind of air is drifting through the office.</p>
<p>"Also, even if it's just a little thing, I messed up the new product."</p>
<p>It has no meaning unless it is a chocolate coin.</p>
<p>"No, no, no."</p>
<p>The outraged Fairy President jumps on the desk.</p>
<p>"This is the President's command. More good things, please. At least, just a little bit."</p>
<p>"But, President."</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"Isn't there not enough subcontractors anymore?"</p>
<p>The company was quiet given the current scene.</p>
<p>A subcontractor who did a really good job. A subcontractor who was a reliable ally. It was very exciting at the year-end party. But they aren't here anymore. It's sad...</p>
<p>A word from the President breaks the silence.</p>
<p>"...Are you new? Can't you find someone?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A UN staff member walked along the road.</p>
<p>"Even in this era."</p>
<p>She seemed to be lost in thought, muttering as she walked.</p>
<p>"There are people who draw illustrations as a hobby...by making it possible to upload such things via the network...creating a mechanism for everyone to see the uploaded illustrations... while promoting comments by adding comments and so on... introducing rankings to fuel the sense of events...yeah. I wonder if I can go? It's difficult for each person to prepare the equipment for that purpose, but it's better to install the equipment in a place like a caf&eacute;..."</p>
<p>Apparently, she was thinking about her hobby.</p>
<p>It was an innovative network service idea that would attract more than 10 million members worldwide.</p>
<p>Too bad. It was a little late to come up with something like this (by hundreds or thousands of years).</p>
<p>"If it can be implemented, then I can collect personal information as much as I want; it will be easier for people to mobilize, it will be easier to find new talent, it will be my achievement, and I will be able to eat for the rest of my life..."<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>4<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>While looking up at the sky, she was thinking about something, like a cloud, and she ended up finding something unfamiliar to the street.</p>
<p>"Oh, a vending machine? No, it's cardboard...yes, it seems like it's the fairies' doing."</p>
<p>She immediately noticed that the vending machine was a fairy's work. She's an authorized person.</p>
<p>"Which product am I interested in..."</p>
<p>She seems excited, and, in fact, she checks the display with a professional eye.</p>
<p>A vacuum space with a can, an exquisitely made poison spider-type paperweight, an external light desk lamp, and a stamp self-made machine.</p>
<p>Apparently, it was a little different from the woman's taste.</p>
<p>"Hmm. I wonder if this kind of cultural fashion goods is her area of expertise. Should I bring it as a souvenir?"</p>
<p>She picks up the coin that is on the side of the road and put it in the slit. However.</p>
<p>"...It only accepts chocolate coins. Hmm."</p>
<p>The woman gave up and walked along the road.</p>
<p>After 30 minutes, she returned with a lot of chocolate coins.</p>
<p>She has unbeatable procurement and mobilization skills only in the fields she is interested in.</p>
<p>"I regret it after completing it. This is the secret of the adult collection way."</p>
<p>And she says this as she did it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"This month's sales target: 500 chocolate coins! Currently...230 coins."</p>
<p>President Fairy is in a good mood.</p>
<p>"Is it good? Is this it?"</p>
<p>"By the way, President."</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"There is a request form from a client!"</p>
<p>Employee Fairy hands the request form attached to the vending machine to the president.</p>
<p>It was written as follows.</p>
<img src="/photos/jintai/JintaiHeijouUntenCH1_pt3.jpg" style="width:550px;height:550px;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>・Request Form</strong></p>
<p><em>Isn't it possible to have a tool that can fly freely in the sky that doesn't have enough product impact and should have more of a burning feeling? The village is now an unprecedented move boom, but can we make it easier?</em></p>
<p><em>I want to make it easier at home because my health checkup is troublesome (a proposition!). By unifying the standard of chocolate coins, it is possible to build a new business scheme.</em></p>
<p><em>By doing so, an interactive profit structure will be created that includes not only your company, but also chocolate coin manufacturers, as well as intermediaries. We have a strong pipe with a chocolate coin manufacturer!</em></p>
<p><em>If we can fulfill these orders, we can promise 200 coins by the next month.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"...This is...crap...client!"</p>
<p>Shivers ran throughout the office.</p>
<p>A client is equal to God.</p>
<p>There is no possible way to go against it.</p>
<p>Think of this client's order as unreasonable as the company's inclinations. It is what determines whether or not to receive the 200 coins as a reward.</p>
<p>The company's goal is 500 coins. However, the amount presented by the client is 200 coins. Not enough.</p>
<p>But it is a stable income. We don't have enough.</p>
<p>Refuse the client and aim for 500 coins, or jump immediately to 200 coins?</p>
<p>It is a moment when the judgment of a business person is asked.</p>
<p>"President, what are you going to do?" "Is it too full?" "Aren't there new subcontractors?" "I saw them a while ago, but they're already doing the koala's death march."<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>5<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>&nbsp;"We're in trouble."</p>
<p>"President, what are you going to do?"</p>
<p>The employee fairies get closer to the Fairy President.</p>
<p>The Fairy President turns his back to everyone and makes a serious announcement.</p>
<p>"...I will have to look at my favorite book."</p>
<p>President Fairy throws out his favorite book onto the desk.</p>
<p>It was a manuscript of an Asian comic book (of unknown age).</p>
<p>The title was literally "Chief Island Kosaku".<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>6<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>&nbsp;It is a story about an Asian person named Kosaku going out of his way while achieving success and a good social standing in an island country called Chief Island.</p>
<p>According to the comic, it is important to work according to your beliefs.</p>
<p>"This, this is?"</p>
<p>"According to your beliefs...I will receive this work!"</p>
<p>"However, President, the subcontractors...!"</p>
<p>The company was quiet given the current scene.</p>
<p>They were new subcontractors who accepted the job with a cheap guarantee of being paid on time since the company could not afford it. That was a really big help. It was an enjoyable business meeting with constant laughter. At that point, it's not just work anymore. It's like having friends. It was so wonderful to meet them!</p>
<p>A word from the President breaks silence.</p>
<p>"...I hope the next subcontractors will be good people too."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"...Is it chocolate coins again?"</p>
<p>The young director of the mediation office laments when she reads the letter.</p>
<p>As an alternative to the previous director, the new director is still young. Whether it is a lie or a truth, the fairy's services can be used freely.</p>
<p>"Are there any incidents?"</p>
<p>A woman, a colleague, said at the same time as the director spoke.</p>
<p>"It's not an incident, but lately I've been asked by the village people to make sweets for charity, bazaars, meetings, etc."</p>
<p>"The name of a sweets maker has been sold. That's good."</p>
<p>"...Even so, it's all chocolate coins."</p>
<p>"Chocolate coins aren't good. Although, they're easy to eat and I'm happy to get them. How much can I make?"</p>
<p>"...It's too unnatural for everyone to have the same order."</p>
<p>"You have a chocolate coin packing machine. It will take just a moment to use it."</p>
<p>"I don't mean to say that it takes effort...it's just unnatural for people to ask for the same things at the same time."</p>
<p>"If you suspect that kind of thing all the time, you'll have to search for the culprit even when the button is taken off."</p>
<p>The director suggested this in a silent manner.</p>
<p>A chocolate coin packing machine is a convenient machine that automatically produces chocolate coins if you pour in the ingredients.</p>
<p>"...Isn't it suspicious?"</p>
<p>"How can you live by being this skeptical?! You're the new director of this office, right? You need to get along with the people of the village! It's not suspicious, it's trivial. Look at this blue sky! I don't care about trivial suspicions!"</p>
<p>From the window on the third floor of the mediation office, they could see the magnificent scenery.</p>
<p>An old man, who grew a flight rotor from his back, crossed the blue sky in a posture like a cat hung by its neck.</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>If you look closely, the old man is not the only one flying. There are many other residents who are flying rotors.</p>
<p>"Oh my god, I'll be late for a date." Ah, youth.</p>
<p>"Today's field work was tough, I'll go home and have a drink..." A man with a lot of work.</p>
<p>"Ahh, the curfew is over~, I must hurry!" A girl.</p>
<p>It's not just people who are in a hurry.</p>
<p>When the director suddenly turned his head sideways, three middle-aged women were hovering and having a gossiping session.</p>
<p>"Hey wife, did you hear? There are rumors of a new family who moved to 3rd Street!"</p>
<p>"I didn't know, is that what happened?"</p>
<p>"That's what I heard! Apparently the wife of that house is divorced!"</p>
<p>"I can't believe that! Then, does she have any stepchildren?"</p>
<p>Recently, tools that fly freely in the sky were popular in the village.</p>
<p>"...No matter how you think about it, it's a fairy's tool, right?"</p>
<p>"Do you think so? I don't think it's good to jump to rash conclusions like that. Since you're the head of the village, I think it's important to accept the actions of the village people with a sense of generosity. That forgiving spirit is the future of the village..."</p>
<p>A backpack that can fly in the sky when carried on your back, a lantern that can compress any large object into a pocket size when exposed to light, and a patch that will give you a health check when attached.</p>
<p>Many of these three types of tools have been seized from the village.</p>
<p>"It's your job to handle this, right?"</p>
<p>"...Yup."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"This month's sales target has reached 200,000 coin chocolates!"</p>
<p>President Fairy, who used to be in a suit with a plain color, is now wearing a golden shining suit. It's very shiny.</p>
<p>"So President, are we safe?"</p>
<p>"President, we're in the clear!"</p>
<p>The employee fairies all have gorgeous outfits.</p>
<p>Not only what they are wearing, but the interior of the company is also shiny.</p>
<p>"Even though you made it, did you think something that could fly would sell well?"</p>
<p>There were so many chocolate coins in the safe inside the company.</p>
<p>Never in the fairies' lives had such a large quantity of sweets been present until now.</p>
<p>There is no more playing pretend!</p>
<p>"President, are you going to take a picture of your car?"</p>
<p>"Oh, it came, it came."</p>
<p>When the Fairy President left the building, an ultra-luxury car was parked there.</p>
<p>It was a new car that can be bought with extra chocolate coins. Well, it's a radio-controlled car.</p>
<p>"President, the car you want to buy is over here."</p>
<p>The dealer fairy is approaching in an obsequious manner.</p>
<p>"Mmm. Good work."</p>
<p>"The price for the car is 200 coins, do you want it?"</p>
<p>"I'll pay for it."</p>
<p>"Okay, President, we have a deal."</p>
<p>The Secretary Fairy hands over twenty bags of chocolate coins to the dealer fairy. The President got into his luxury car.</p>
<p>"Sorry for the intrusion."</p>
<p>At that time, the radio-controlled luxury car was starting to move vigorously.</p>
<p>"This is the Kusunoki tax office. This is a tax investigation. And this is an arrest."</p>
<p>Suddenly a human in a white coat suddenly lifted the radio-controlled car. They are the director of the mediation office.</p>
<p>"Ahh!"</p>
<img src="/photos/jintai/JintaiHeijouUntenCH1_pt4.jpg" style="width:1200px;height:1700px;">
<p>"I will be confiscating this on suspicion of tax evasion."</p>
<p>"I give!"</p>
<p>"The building also collapsed."</p>
<p>A woman in black, who came along with the director, demolished the cardboard building that was used as an office. This trick is...professional!</p>
<p>"Father, father, father!"</p>
<p>The fairies ran away into the depths of the forest. "They're too far now, but..."</p>
<p>The mediator, who had a stake in the fairy company, was apologetic.</p>
<p>"From now on, it will become important to do this in an accelerated manner."</p>
<p>"It was the best time to intervene. As expected of the Director."</p>
<p>"Oh, my ambition."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You are responsible for writing all the reports. Please do a moderately decent one!"</p>
<p>"Ahh..."</p>
<p>"The fairies would have been good boring companions."</p>
<p>Thus, peace returned to the village.</p>
<p>Well, from the beginning it was still peaceful.</p>
<p>The Kusunoki village looked like this for a while.</p>

<ol class="references">
<li id="cite_note-1">&nbsp;<span class="reference-text"><strong>"The end"</strong>&nbsp;- The word used here, "しゅーかつ," refers to job-hunting, but when replacing that with the kanji "終活," it can be used as a play-on-words for "preparing for the end (death)."</span></li>
<br>
<li id="cite_note-2">&nbsp;<span class="reference-text"><strong>"Black Company"</strong>&nbsp;- A "black company" is basically a term for an "exploitative sweatshop-type employment system."</span></li>
<br>
<li id="cite_note-3">&nbsp;<span class="reference-text"><strong>"Que será será"</strong>&nbsp;- A Spanish phrase that translates to "whatever will be, will be," which is often used in hopeless situations that one has come to begrudgingly accept ("there's nothing I can do about it now").</span></li>
<br>
<li id="cite_note-4">&nbsp;<span class="reference-text"><strong>"Eat For The Rest of My Life"</strong>&nbsp;- This phrase is basically saying that she will be able to make a good living and not have to worry about anything like food or money for the rest of her life (as seen with the phrase used here 食いっぱぐれない).</span></li>
<br>
<li id="cite_note-5">&nbsp;<span class="reference-text"><strong>"Koala's Death March"</strong>&nbsp;- Refers to &lsquo;a fun scene in which koalas will continue to come to Japan like marching bands,' although in this case, it's a death march.</span></li>
<br>
<li id="cite_note-6">&nbsp;<span class="reference-text"><strong>"Chief Island Kosaku"</strong>&nbsp;- Based on a real novel of the same name with the description being "a story of a company employee who survived because he remained independent regardless of the high economic growth era of the Japanese economy in the era of the bubble burst." It's supposed to be ironically similar to this situation.</span></li>
